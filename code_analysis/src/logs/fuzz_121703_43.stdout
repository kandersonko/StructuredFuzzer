[1;91m[-] [0mHmm, your system is configured to send core dump notifications to an
    external utility. This will cause issues: there will be an extended delay
    between stumbling upon a crash and having this information relayed to the
    fuzzer via the standard waitpid() API.
    If you're just testing, set 'AFL_I_DONT_CARE_ABOUT_MISSING_CRASHES=1'.

    To avoid having crashes misinterpreted as timeouts, please log in as root
    and temporarily modify /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, like so:

    echo core >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

[1;91m[-] [0mThe input directory does not seem to be valid - try again. The fuzzer needs
    one or more test case to start with - ideally, a small file under 1 kB
    or so. The cases must be stored as regular files directly in the input
